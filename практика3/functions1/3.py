#Write a program to solve a classic puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? create function: solve(numheads, numlegs):
def solve(numheads, numlegs):
    for i in range(numheads + 1):
        j = numheads - i
        if 2 * i + 4 * j == numlegs:
            return i, j
    
numheads = 35
numlegs = 94
solutions = solve(numheads, numlegs)
print (solutions)
